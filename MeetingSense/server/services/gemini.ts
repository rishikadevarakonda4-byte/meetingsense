Our primary objectives include improving user experience, streamlining the onboarding process, and implementing advanced reporting capabilities. The scope includes developing a responsive web interface, integrating with our existing authentication system, and creating comprehensive analytics dashboards. Key stakeholders participating in this project are the product management team, engineering department, customer success team, and security compliance officers. We have identified several functional requirements including single sign-on authentication, real-time data synchronization, customizable user profiles, and automated notification systems. Non-functional requirements focus on system performance, with target response times under 2 seconds, 99.9% uptime availability, and compliance with GDPR data protection standards. Our technical constraints include working within the existing AWS infrastructure, maintaining compatibility with legacy systems, and ensuring mobile responsiveness across all major browsers. The project timeline spans 16 weeks with key milestones including requirements finalization by week 4, design completion by week 8, development finish by week 14, and testing completion by week 16. Budget allocation covers development resources, third-party integrations, security audits, and contingency planning.",
